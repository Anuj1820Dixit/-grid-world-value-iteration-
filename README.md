# -grid-world-value-iteration-
This is a basic RL game - "grid world" 
This repository contains an implementation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent solving a Grid World problem using the Value Iteration algorithm. The agent navigates a 3x3 grid to reach a goal state while avoiding obstacles and maximizing rewards.

The agent uses the Value Iteration algorithm to learn the optimal policy that determines the best actions to take in each state, given a set of rewards, penalties, and obstacles. This project serves as a basic introduction to reinforcement learning concepts such as dynamic programming, value iteration, and optimal policy extraction.
